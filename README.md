# FLOW OS
An x86 operating system project designed for QEMU emulation (for now). This personal project represents my development journey in OS internals, built from scratch to understand low-level system operations.

Project Goals:

- Create a functioning bootable system

- Achieve easy installation process

- Maintain lightweight performance

- Ensure high compatibility with hardware

- Develop robust driver support

- Distribute as open-source software

- "FLOW" - optimize for fast, smooth experience 

More specific goals:
| Area               | Minimum Feature                           | Why It Matters                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Boot + Memory**  | Bootloader loads kernel, paging enabled   | You understand memory management & segmentation     |
| **Tasking**        | Basic scheduler (round-robin or priority) | You understand concurrency primitives               |
| **Interrupts**     | Handle timer + keyboard interrupts        | Shows control over CPU state                        |
| **File/IO System** | Read/write simple FS (FAT12 or custom)    | Demonstrates block device I/O knowledge             |
| **Syscalls**       | A few system calls for user programs      | Proves you understand kernel â†” user mode            |
| **Documentation**  | README + architecture notes               | Shows you can communicate technical systems clearly |


## Current Development Focus

**FAT12 Filesystem Implementation** - Learning and implementing disk operations for this simple filesystem format, which serves as a foundation for storage management.

For now, FAT12 in c has been working, the following step is how to test fat.c 

## Installation

1. Git clone

```
git clone git@github.com:tuanminh25/os.git
```


2. Navigate to root folder of the project and build the program by running : 

```
make
```

3. Run test for fat.c by runing:

```
./build/tools/fat ./build/main_floppy.img "TEST    TXT"
```

## Extra tools development

- I plan to implement a memory allocation simulator once we reach to the point of managing memory.

## Contributions

This project can serve as an educational resource for others learning OS development.

Thanks to NANOBYTE for providing the inspiration and tutorials that made this project possible.
