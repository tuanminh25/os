Right, so the kernel itself is a manager 

It manages itself and the user space application (memory)

Normally it will starts somewhere after 1MiB, it first starts with

1. Text (or the kernel program code)

2. Then it comes to Initiallized data segment (from the kernel)

3. Then it comes to Uninitiallized data segment or bss (declared or init = 0 from the kernel )

4. Then it comes to Heap, grows upward

Heap would store what 

--- A blank unallocated memory here which will be dynamically allocated ---

5. The stack top (growing downward)

Stack would store local variable



better representation would be like this

0x00000000 ── BIOS + Bootloader (reserved)

0x00100000 ── Kernel starts here

     ↓

[ .text ]          ← Kernel code

[ .data ]          ← Kernel initialized globals/statics

[ .bss ]           ← Kernel uninitialized globals/statics (zeroed at boot)

[ Heap ]           ← Kernel heap: stores kernel structures (task structs, page tables, device info)

[ ... free memory for dynamic use ... ]

[ Stack top ]      ← Kernel stack (grows downward)




2️⃣ Each user-space process layout

[ Text (code) ]      ← Executable instructions

[ Data (initialized) ] ← Global/static initialized variables

[ BSS (uninitialized) ] ← Global/static zeroed variables

[ Heap ]             ← Process dynamic allocations (malloc, new, textures, etc.)

[ Stack top ]        ← Process stack (grows downward)


and yea kernel manage those thing:

- Each process has its own virtual address space; kernel maps them to physical RAM.

- Kernel tracks all these mappings in its heap/structures.

- Heap grows upward, stack grows downward — eventually, if they collide, the process crashes (stack overflow/heap overflow).

3️⃣ How it all fits together

Kernel is the manager: small footprint (heap + stack + code/data/bss)

Processes are the workers: each gets its own text/data/bss/heap/stack

Kernel heap/stack store metadata about all user processes and memory allocations

Physical RAM holds both kernel and user-space memory at the same time, coordinated by the ke
