Alright so this would be the main entry on the big decision such as bootloader, kind of kernel, boot protocol, os features stuff

1. Bootloader
So we start off with boot, well, after a while of researching, we chose GRUB as our way to go as it seems to be widely supported and somewhat beginner friendly

2. Boot protocol
As a follow through, we will design the kernel compliance to Multiboot2 protocol as it is the best fit for GRUB
