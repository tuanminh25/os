bootloader choice 


initially this project will go in the direction where bootloader will be self-written, however it seems like it would be much hassle to do especially a lot to deal wit assembly so we will switch direction into use another well written bootloader already


after a while , we decided to go with GRUB as it seems to be the most robust, easy to use, most compatible

this is other option to consider apart from GRUB if one day we decide to switch:

| Bootloader                    | Typical use               | Pros                                                         | Cons                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Limine**                    | Hobby OSDev, x86-64       | Simple, modern, supports Stivale2 protocol, cleaner codebase | Fewer platforms than GRUB, newer project  |
| **systemd-boot (gummiboot)**  | Modern Linux, UEFI only   | Lightweight, fast, integrates with systemd                   | Only boots EFI executables (no Multiboot) |
| **rEFInd**                    | Multiboot manager for EFI | Good GUI, autodetects OSes                                   | Not meant for low-level OS dev            |
| **Coreboot + SeaBIOS/Heads**  | Open firmware stack       | Secure, open hardware                                        | Complex build process, niche              |
| **U-Boot**                    | Embedded/ARM/RISC-V       | Extremely configurable for boards                            | Not ideal for PCs, more for SoCs          |
| **Bare-metal custom loaders** | OS development learning   | Full control                                                 | Requires assembly, more work              |


with this, we have decided on using combo x86 + GRUB
