## Milestone 2: Bare Minimum Kernel - Overview
# Flow for the Kernel

1. Bootloader loads kernel into memory

2. Bootloader transfers control to kernel entry point

3. Kernel initializes:
    + CPU state
    + Video output
    + Interrupt handlers
    + Basic keyboard input


Question:
1. What is CLI?
cli = "Clear Interrupt Flag." - Disable hardware interrupts by clearing interrupt flag in CPU flag register
- When disabled, cpu wont respond to external interrupt request from hardware device (why?)

2. Flow of program kernel_entry.asm 
    - The program begins at _start
    - Sets up the stack pointer (esp) to point to the top of the kernel stack
    - Calls the C++ function kernel_main (defined elsewhere)
    - If kernel_main ever returns (which it typically shouldn't in an OS kernel):
        + Disables interrupts with cli
        + Halts the CPU with hlt
        + If execution somehow continues, the jmp $ creates an infinite loop

3. What is _start and when is it triggered
_start is the entry point of the kernel. It's the first code executed when control is transferred to the kernel from the bootloader

The bootloader loads the kernel into memory and jumps to this entry point

The global _start directive makes this symbol visible to the linker so it can be referenced from outside this file.

4. [bits 32] vs [bits 16] for bootloader
[bits 16] is used for the bootloader because the CPU starts in 16-bit real mode when a computer boots up.

[bits 32] is used here because this code is for the kernel which runs after the bootloader has switched the CPU to 32-bit protected mode.

The change is necessary because 32-bit protected mode offers memory protection, larger address space, and other features needed for a modern OS.

5. What is section .bss?
The .bss section is used for uninitialized data in assembly and C programs. 
Variables in this section are allocated space in memory but aren't given initial values (they're zero-initialized by default)

In this code, it's used to reserve space for the kernel stack.

6. Kernel and kernel stack:
Kernel: The kernel is the core component of an operating system 
    + that manages system resources
    +  provides hardware abstraction
    +  offers services to applications.
    + It's the first program loaded after the bootloader
    + direct control over hardware.

Kernel stack: dedicated area of memory used for 
    + function calls, 
    + local variables
    +  procedure returns within the kernel code

kernel_stack_bottom marks the beginning of this space
kernel_stack_top marks the end
stacks typically grow downward in x86 
-> also why stack pointer is set at the top
