1️⃣ Yes, the OS “lives” in RAM

When your computer is running, the entire OS kernel (text, data, bss, heap, stacks, etc.) sits in RAM.

RAM is fast, directly accessible by the CPU. This is why the kernel and all running processes are loaded there — CPU cannot execute code directly from SSD.

Even user-space programs (games, browsers, etc.) are also loaded into RAM when running.

2️⃣ What happens if you run out of physical RAM?

This is where virtual memory comes in:

The OS uses paging to map virtual addresses to physical addresses.

If RAM is full, the OS can swap pages out to storage (SSD/HDD) temporarily.

This storage-backed memory is much slower, but it allows the system to appear as if there’s “more RAM” than physically exists.

This is why you sometimes hear that a system “uses SSD as RAM” — it’s really swap space / page file, managed by the OS.
