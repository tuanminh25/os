directive: tell the assembler
instruction: will be translated into machine code

## org
org : tells assembler where we expect our code to be loaded. The assembler uses 
this infor to calculate label addresses

org 0x7C00 - change 0x7C00 mean tell assembler to load our code at some 
other offset position in memory


## bits
tells assembler to emit 16/32/64 bit code
this wont run the code in 32 bit code, it just tells the assembler to emit 32 bit code

## db byte1, byte2, byte3,...
define byte(s). Write given bytes to the assembled binary file

## times number instruction/ data
repeat given instruction or piece of data a number of times

# dw word1
define words, write given words (2bytes value encoded in little endian) to
the assembled bianry file
