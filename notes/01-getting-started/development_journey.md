The goal of this project is just for me to learn more about os. That's it. Hopefully that one day this one would be "flowy" or just smooth, fast, light, breathy just as a wind breath

Since I have 0 idea about this before hand, the best way to approach this right now is to watch tutorial and figure out along the way with the tutorial

The source that I found on the internet that signals to me to be the most "interesting and easy to approach is from Nanobyte". The first lesson is here:
