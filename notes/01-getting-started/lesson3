To read a FAT12 filesystem image, you need these key components:

1. Boot sector parser - reads filesystem metadata like sector size, sectors per cluster, and FAT location
2. FAT table reader - loads the File Allocation Table that tracks cluster chains
3. Root directory reader - parses directory entries containing filenames and file metadata
4. Cluster chain follower - reads file data by following linked clusters in the FAT

The essential data structures are:
- Boot sector structure (contains filesystem parameters)
- Directory entry structure (stores file metadata)
- FAT lookup logic (converts between clusters and physical sectors)

The critical process involves:
1. Reading the boot sector first for filesystem parameters
2. Loading the FAT to understand cluster chains
3. Reading the root directory to find files
4. Following cluster chains in the FAT to read complete files
