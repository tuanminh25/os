1️⃣ Why GRUB scans the first 32 KB

It’s not the whole ISO, it’s the first 32 KB of the kernel binary loaded into memory.

GRUB looks here to find the Multiboot2 header quickly without scanning the entire file.

The 32 KB limit is part of the Multiboot2 spec; headers outside this range may be ignored.

2️⃣ What .align 8 means

Align = memory address multiple requirement. .align 8 forces the header to start at an address divisible by 8.

CPUs are faster when reading aligned memory, and some instructions may fault on misaligned access.

If you don’t align: GRUB may misread the header fields, and your kernel might fail to boot.





Purpose of grub.cfg

+ grub.cfg is the GRUB bootloader configuration file.

+ It tells GRUB what kernels or OS entries to boot, default options, and timeout.

+ Without it, GRUB may start but won’t know which OS or kernel to load.
