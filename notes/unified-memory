Unified Memory (Apple M1/M2 terminology)

Apple calls it Unified Memory Architecture (UMA).

The key idea: CPU, GPU, and other accelerators share the same physical memory pool.

So instead of having separate RAM for CPU and GPU, all components access the same RAM.

It’s still RAM — fast, directly addressable — not the SSD.
