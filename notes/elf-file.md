1. What is .elf?

.elf stands for Executable and Linkable Format.

It’s a standard file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps on Unix-like systems.

Structure:

Header → CPU type, entry point, sections info.

Sections → code (.text), data (.data), read-only data (.rodata), etc.

Symbols & metadata → for linking/debugging.

ELF files can be directly executed or loaded by a bootloader that understands the format, like GRUB.


2. Why .elf and not .o?

.o = object file, usually generated by the compiler.

It’s not fully linked, may contain unresolved references.

Cannot be directly executed; it’s an intermediate file.

.elf (when used as kernel) is:

Fully linked and bootable.

Contains an entry point GRUB can jump to.

Multiboot-compliant ELF → GRUB knows how to load it into memory.

Bottom line:

.o → intermediate, not executable.

.elf → fully linked, bootable kernel, needed for GRUB to load.
